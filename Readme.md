# genai-ecommerce-auto-labeling
A GenAI-powered auto-labeling system for e-commerce products using LLMs and prompt engineering to reduce mislabeling under ambiguous language conditions.

**GenAI-Based Auto-Labeling System for E-Commerce Products**
**(Hybrid Rules + LLM Architecture | Azure OpenAI)**

**📌 Project Overview**

E-commerce aggregator platforms often struggle with **inconsistent product labeling** due to unstructured seller inputs. This mislabeling leads to poor product discoverability, customer dissatisfaction, and revenue loss.

This project implements a **production oriented GenAI auto-labeling system** that classifies ambiguous product descriptions into:

Skin Care

Hair Care

Using Azure OpenAI LLMs, the system compares zero-shot and few-shot prompt engineering approaches and evaluates their performance using multiple randomized runs, reporting mean accuracy and standard deviation.
Rather than relying solely on LLMs, the system adopts a hybrid architecture (Rules + LLM) to ensure reliability under Azure OpenAI Responsible AI constraints.

**❓ Problem Statement**

The platform currently experiences approximately 27% product mislabeling, particularly between Skin Care and Hair Care categories.

**_Key Challenges_**

  Overlapping terminology (e.g., oil, wash, powder)
  
  Ambiguity between scalp care, body hair, and skin treatments
  
  Inconsistent and unstructured seller-provided descriptions
  
  Limited availability of labeled training data

Manual seller education efforts failed, necessitating an automated, intelligent labeling solution.

**🚨 Key Real-World Challenge Discovered**

During experimentation, **Azure OpenAI content filters blocked a significant portion of LLM classification requests**, even though the task was _non-generative and purely classificatory_.

  Retail terms such as body, massage, waist, lip balm, beard oil triggered **medium-severity sexual content filters**.

This made **LLM-only approaches unreliable** in practice.

**Why Hybrid?**

Rules handle **high-confidence cases deterministically**

LLM handles **semantic ambiguity**

System remains **functional even when LLM is blocked**

**Classification Strategies Evaluated**

| Strategy                 | Description                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Zero-Shot LLM            | Instruction-only classification  |
| Few-Shot LLM             | Prompt includes labeled examples |
| **Hybrid (Rules + LLM)** | Rules first, LLM fallback        |

**Evaluation Methodology**

  Dataset split into:

    **Rule / few-shot example pool**

    **Gold evaluation set**

  5 randomized evaluation runs

  Metrics reported:

    **Mean accuracy**

    **Standard deviation**

**📊 Results Summary**

| Method                   | Mean Accuracy | Std Dev  | Observations                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Zero-Shot LLM            | 0.00          | 0.00     | Azure content filtering blocked most requests |
| Few-Shot LLM             | 0.00          | 0.00     | Longer prompts increased filter failures      |
| **Hybrid (Rules + LLM)** | **0.625**     | **0.00** | Stable, reliable, production-viable           |

**🔍 Key Observations & Learnings**
  
**LLM-only pipelines can collapse under Responsible AI constraints**

Azure OpenAI content filtering applies even to **classification tasks**

Few-shot prompting can **increase filter risk** due to longer prompts

Hybrid architectures significantly improve:

  Reliability

  Cost efficiency

  Predictability

Deterministic rules reduce LLM dependency and operational risk

**🛡️ Handling Azure OpenAI Content Filtering**

To ensure uninterrupted execution:

  LLM calls are wrapped with **fail-safe logic**

  When Azure blocks a request:

    The system **does not crash**

    A **safe fallback label ** is applied

  Evaluation pipelines are designed to tolerate model unavailability

This mirrors **real enterprise GenAI systems**, where LLM access is **not guaranteed**.
